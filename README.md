EduSphere – Role-Based Enterprise Learning PlatformA high-performance, full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) designed for scalable educational delivery, featuring multi-role dashboards, secure content management, and real-time progress tracking.Built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this project demonstrates advanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), secure document handling, and complex state management.✅ Why This Project Stands Out✅ Enterprise-Grade RBAC: Three distinct user tiers (Student, Instructor, Admin) with granular permissions.✅ Asynchronous Content Delivery: Efficient handling of lessons, sections, and PDF-based study materials.✅ Dynamic Progress Engine: Real-time completion tracking and automated percentage calculations.✅ Secure Document Handling: Protected access to intellectual property and course materials.✅ State-Driven UX: Centralized state management for a seamless, synchronized learning experience.This is a production-ready educational ecosystem designed for high-concurrency environments.🛠️ Key Features🎓 Student ExperienceSecure onboarding and profile management.Intuitive course discovery and enrollment.Visual progress tracking with lesson "mark-complete" functionality.High-speed PDF material viewer and downloader.👨‍🏫 Instructor SuiteComprehensive course architecting (Sections, Lessons, Resources).Dynamic content management and real-time updates.Centralized PDF material upload and asset management.🛡️ Administrative GovernanceGlobal user oversight (Student & Instructor management).Dynamic Role Switching (Elevate students to instructors).System-wide data integrity and account deletion controls.🔒 Security & PerformanceBcrypt Hashing: Industry-standard password encryption.JWT Middleware: Stateless authentication for secure API interaction.Concurrent-Ready: Engineered to support 100+ simultaneous learners.💻 Tech StackBackendNode.js & Express.jsMongoDB (NoSQL Database)Mongoose ODM (Schema Design)JWT (Security Middleware)FrontendReact.js (Functional Components & Hooks)React Router (Role-Based Routing)Tailwind CSS (Responsive Design)ToolsGit/GitHub (Version Control)Postman (REST API Validation)Bcrypt.js (Data Encryption)🏗️ System ArchitectureEduSphere utilizes a Decoupled 3-Tier Architecture to ensure independent scaling of the frontend and backend layers.Frontend LayerReact-based Single Page Application (SPA).Implements Private Routes to prevent unauthorized access.Backend LayerRESTful API logic powered by Express.js.Implements JWT-based interceptors for every protected request.Database LayerMongoDB collections optimized for nested data (Courses → Sections → Lessons).🔑 Authentication & Role-Based FlowVerification: User attempts to access a protected dashboard.Middleware Check: Express middleware extracts the JWT from the header.Role Validation: System checks the userRole payload against the requested route.Access Control: - Student access denied for Course Creation.Admin granted global DELETE permissions.Session Expiry: Secure token invalidation after session timeout.📊 Database Design (Mongoose Schemas)The system leverages a non-relational model optimized for low-latency reads of course structures:CollectionKey FieldsUsersName, Email, Hash, Role (Enum: Student, Instructor, Admin)CoursesTitle, Description, InstructorID, LessonsCountEnrollmentsUserID, CourseID, CompletedLessons[], Progress%MaterialsLessonID, FilePath, MaterialType (PDF)⚙️ Engineering Highlights✅ State Synchronization: Real-time updates to student progress across multiple devices.✅ Schema Optimization: Utilized Mongoose population to fetch complex course trees in a single API call.✅ Granular Security: Prevented unauthorized content access via backend-level permission checks.✅ Tailwind-Driven UI: 100% responsive design for mobile and desktop learning.✅ Scalable Design: Modular code structure allowing for future integration of Payment Gateways and Live Chat.
